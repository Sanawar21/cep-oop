## Project Overview 
This project is a web application built using Flask for my Object-Oriented Programming course's term project. The app demonstrates various principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The Flask framework itself is not object-oriented conventionally and it is used to build APIs and static web pages. This posed significant challenges during the development of this web app.
